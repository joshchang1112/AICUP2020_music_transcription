# AICUP2020_music_transcription

## Competition description

With the development of the times, the way of listening to music has been transferred from the previous CD to various online music platforms, such as Spotify, 
Line Music abroad, KKBOX, Friday Music, etc. According to the 2016 IFPI report, the output value of digital music has officially exceeded the output 
value of physical music, and the output value of physical music is declining year after year, showing that the trend is on the side of digital music.

The aim of this competition is to attempt to mark the start/end location (or we can say 'onset'/'offset') of the note and its pitch in a song. The contestants will be provided a json file and the youtube link about the song. The json file, which we called it feature.json, has 23 features of every frame in the song, it will helped the contestants to train the deep learning model and get better results.
